# ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ Bharat-CRM â€“ A Simple Gas Agency Management Tool

**Bharat-CRM** is a Java-based desktop CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application built to help Bharat Gas Agencies manage their day-to-day tasks more efficiently. It includes features like booking gas cylinders, viewing refill history, tracking delivery, managing customer details, and more.

This project was built with the goal of simulating a real-world system for managing gas services â€” keeping it modular, clean, and easy to use.

##  What You Can Do with It

- Book new gas cylinders for customers  
- Check previous refill and booking history  
- Manage customer details like name, address, and connection status  
- Track delivery agents and cylinder delivery status  
- View agency-level reports like cylinder counts  
- Provide basic customer support interactions

---

##  How the Project is Structured

The code is divided into multiple packages and modules to keep things organized:

- `Customers` â€“ everything related to customer info and gas connection
- `GasBooking` â€“ handles booking logic, delivery info, and date handling
- `GasSupplier` â€“ represents the gas agency and its operations
- `Main.java` â€“ the entry point where it all comes together

Weâ€™ve used **interfaces, classes, methods, and Java's built-in Date functions** to implement the system step-by-step, focusing on modularity and clarity.

##  Technologies Used

- **Java** â€“ the core language used throughout
- **IntelliJ IDEA** â€“ used for development
- **OOP principles** â€“ interfaces, abstraction, encapsulation
- **Java Date API** â€“ for tracking booking/delivery times

##  Why I Built This

The idea behind this project was to build something that mimics real-world business operations â€” in this case, a local gas agency CRM. It helped me practice:

- Object-oriented design
- Modular development
- Breaking down big problems into manageable parts
- Writing clean, maintainable Java code
